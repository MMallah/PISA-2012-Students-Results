Seems no erronus observation is noticed, so we can head over to the univariate analysis

exploratory visualization
Univariate Exploration

# plotting the 3 Variables of interest
# the math score distribution
main_interest = ['pv1_math','pv1_reading' ,'pv1_science']
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
for series in main_interest:
    main_df[series].plot(kind="hist", alpha=0.3, bins=20);       
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.04,1), loc="upper left")

plt.show()

from the graph above it shows that the scores of interest are normally distributed, without many outliers, also the distribution mean is in the following ranges:
Pv1 for math : 425
Pv1 for reading is around 550
Pv1 for science : 425
Now we explore the other numerical features{ Time spent studying and time spent using the PC}
# plotting the some of the variables that might affect the pv scores
main_factors = ['learn_time_lang','learn_time_math', 'learn_time_science',	'Time of computer use (mins)']

fig = plt.figure()
fig.set_size_inches([20,20])
for c,num in zip(main_factors, np.arange(1,5)):
    ax = fig.add_subplot(5,5,num)
    main_df[c].plot(kind="hist", title=c, ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Discuss the distribution(s) of your variable(s) of interest. Were there any unusual points? Did you need to perform any transformations?
The graphs seems all are right skewed dstributed, with math and science learning time seems very closely related, while for reading languages, students seem to spent more time compared to math and science.

while time spent using the computer seems has more wider variations, could it have an effect on the scores ?
Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
Right skewed dstributedm without any noticable unusual distributions, for these particular features, I haven't introduced any changed or wrangling techniques.

Explore the Gender Distribution
# inspecting the gender count
plt.figure(figsize=(8,4))
base_color = sns.color_palette()[0]
sns.countplot(data = main_df, x = 'Gender', color = base_color)
plt.xticks(rotation = 0);

We notice that the Gender is almost equally distributed, so this will help in giving us a better understanding if there is a relationship between Gender and the 3 Scores without any bias in the upcoming bivariate visualization section.
Explore the top 10 scoring countries
# top scoring countries
mean_score = ['pv1_math_mean', 'pv1_science_mean', 'pv1_reading_mean']

for mean_score in mean_score:
    sns.catplot(y='country', x='vals',\
              data=melted_main_group_country.query('score== @mean_score') \
           , kind='bar'\
           ,order=melted_main_group_country.\
                query('score== @mean_score').sort_values(by='vals', ascending=False).iloc[:10]['country'],
               color="c")



We notice that there are several countries which shows in the top 10 countries repeatedly in the 3 scores, interestingly Asian countries have a strong presence in all 3 scores, they must be doing something different, to have such consisetant high scores.
We need to investigate Asian countries behaviour vs other countries
Bivariate Exploration
In this section, investigate relationships between pairs of variables in your data. Make sure the variables that you cover here have been introduced in some fashion in the previous section (univariate exploration).

# investigate  Score  & class size vs Scores.
corr = country_mean_score.corr()

plt.figure(figsize = [8, 5])
sns.heatmap(corr, annot = True, fmt = '.3f',   cmap = 'vlag_r', center = 0);

We Notice that the Class size have weak negative correlation, with the score, to what extent will it affect the scores? we will find out in scores by country later on.
main_score_by_gender = main_df[['Gender', 'pv1_math', "pv1_reading", "pv1_science"]]

scores =['pv1_math', "pv1_reading", "pv1_science"]
for score in scores:
         sns.catplot(x="Gender", y=score, kind="box", dodge=False, data=main_score_by_gender);



from the above graph, we notice that the distribution of the scores are very close for the reading and math scores, with males always having greater range of values, but both females and males have around the same mean of 500, while for the reading scores we observe that on average female have higher scores than males, which we will investigate further.
otherwise, no large differences between genders
learn_time_by_gender = main_df[['Gender', 'learn_time_math', "learn_time_lang", "learn_time_science",  
                                'Time of computer use (mins)']]

scores =['learn_time_math', "learn_time_lang", "learn_time_science",  'Time of computer use (mins)']
for score in scores:
         sns.catplot(x="Gender", y=score, kind="violin", dodge=False, data=learn_time_by_gender);




we Observe some variances between time spent studying math as distribution of males have wider range, vicer versa for females their distribution has wider range for time spent studying a language and science, with males having a slight more time spent on using the computer for an average between booth Genders.
Multivariate Exploration
Create plots of three or more variables to investigate your data even further. Make sure that your investigations are justified, and follow from your work in the previous sections.

Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?
We Observe that some countries might have longer average study times yet other countries have better scores, this is constantly occurring with China for example, also class size should have played some rule in China having lower scores compared to other countries yet that didn't happen

Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
Some Countries didn't show up on the map, so we had to verify the coutry names and codes to reflect all countries that are in the survey are correctly mapped.

Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?
Canada, USA and Russia among the top countries that students dedicate long study hours especially in science.

We Will now investigate what drives the Chinese students to score more, compared to other students who spent more time and have better student to teacher ratio.

Why China has better scores ?

Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?
Interstingly most of the features have same behavior and patterns between chinese students and the other 3 countries, whether it be the possession of books or ICT devices, or even subjective norms of the students, nothing stands out for the chinese students answer for these features.

Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions?
The Features that don't follow the same pattern as other countries, are the subjective norms regarding parents relationship with math, as it seems Chinese parents compared to parents from the oher countries are less likely to put more emphasize for learning math, or it could be that non chinese parents put social pressure on their children to learn math, that's why these student perform lower than Chinese students.

Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
I have chosen 3 countries having same amount of students particpiating in the survey, to ward off any bias as possible.

Once you're ready to finish your presentation, check your output by using nbconvert to export the notebook and set up a server for the slides. From the terminal or command line, use the following expression:

jupyter nbconvert communicate_data_project_Part 2.ipynb --to slides --post serve --template output_toggle

This should open a tab in your web browser where you can scroll through your presentation. Sub-slides can be accessed by pressing 'down' when viewing its parent slide. Make sure you remove all of the quote-formatted guide notes like this one before you finish your presentation

I haven't removed this note, because it didn't work with me, I have tried to trouble shoot it but still not working, there is another alternative called RISE I have tried but it didn't give the same interactivity(hiding and unhiding the subplot slides) as desired
